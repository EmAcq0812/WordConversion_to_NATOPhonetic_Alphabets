# Word Conversion_to_NATO Phonetic_Alphabets
More often than we are caught up trying to spell our name or word to another person on the other side of a phone call. It can be frustrating expecially when 
the person on the other side is not conversant with your accent.
Mostly, we try to use common words that matches the letters in the name or word to aid this process. For instance, to spell the name "Yaw", which the name of 
a male Thursday born in Ghana, you could say; "Y" for yellow", "A for apple" and "w for wizard."
However, using the NATO phonetic words makes this task much more easier as the words chosen are words that are common in everyday language.
